Image encryption and decryption using AES Algorithm 

The prevalence of devices like computers and mobile phones for communication, data storage, and transmission has significantly increased in recent times. This surge in usage has led to a corresponding rise in unauthorized users attempting to access data through illicit means, thus highlighting the issue of data security. Images transmitted over insecure channels from various sources may contain sensitive information, and some images are highly confidential, making it essential to protect them from potential attacks. 
To address this challenge, we employ the AES algorithm for encrypting and decrypting images. The encrypted data becomes unreadable to unauthorized users, allowing it to be transmitted over the network and decrypted using AES on the receiving end. This approach ensures secure image transmission. 

Aim of the project: 
The primary goal of this project is to establish a secure method for transferring images between the sender and receiver. Images must be encrypted prior to transmission over the network and accurately decrypted on the recipientâ€™s side.
